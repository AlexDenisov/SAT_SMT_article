\section{Introduction}

\ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT} solvers can be viewed as solvers of huge systems of equations.
The difference is that \ac{SMT} solvers takes systems in arbitrary format,
while \ac{SAT} solvers are limited to boolean equations in CNF form.

A lot of real world problems can be represented as problems of solving system of equations.

\section{Is it a hype? Yet another fad?}

Some people say, this is just another hype.
No, \ac{SAT} is old enough and fundamental to \ac{CS}.
The reason of increased interest to it is that computers gets faster over the last couple decades,
so there are attempts to solve problems using \ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT}, which were inaccessible in past.
