\section{Introduction}

SAT/SMT solvers can be viewed as solvers of huge systems of equations.
The difference is that SMT solvers takes systems in arbitrary format,
while SAT solvers are limited to boolean equations in CNF form.

A lot of real world problems can be represented as problems of solving system of equations.
