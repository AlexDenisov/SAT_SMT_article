\section{Introduction}

\ac{SAT}/\ac{SMT} solvers can be viewed as solvers of huge systems of equations.
The difference is that \ac{SMT} solvers takes systems in arbitrary format,
while \ac{SAT} solvers are limited to boolean equations in CNF form.

A lot of real world problems can be represented as problems of solving system of equations.
