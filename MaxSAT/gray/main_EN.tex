\subsection{Gray code in MaxSAT}
\label{Gray_MaxSAT}

This is remake of gray code generator for Z3 (\ref{Gray_Z3}).

Here is also \textit{ch[]} table, but we add soft clauses for it here.
The goal is to make as many \textit{False}'s in \textit{ch[]} table, as possible.

\lstinputlisting{MaxSAT/gray/gray_SAT.py}

So it does, for 5-bit Gray code:

\lstinputlisting{MaxSAT/gray/5.txt}
